now that we want to productionize it, don't you think the best way will be to:
1. query planet api
2. download assets
3. run some analysis like creating ndvi, evi, dirt etc etc
4. run the statistical analysis on each of the stats (as per the snippet I sent you in slack, from preparation.ipynb, e.g. for ndvi_man, ndvi80, evi_mean, evi_80, haze etc)
5. save the statiscial analysis into the associated asset
4. save to the ndvi,evi,dirt to csv
5. save to s3
6. delete copy in django machine
-------------------------- in separate daily task -------------------
7. run cohort analysis (in analysis.ipynb) by querying the asset table
8. generate plots and alerts
